# Algorithm

## Version
1.0

## Build and Runtime Requirements
Xcode 11.0 or later
iOS 13.0 or later

## Frameworks Used  
UIKit


## About App
It contains Various Algorithms (mainly focused on `Swift` language).

## Features
### Anagram
- Check Anagram between two strings
- Find all possible Anagrams of a given String.
### Array_Algorithm
- Find min/max object in unsorted array (Using Protocols).
### Longest_Contiguous_Sub-Array
- Find longest subarray sequence in a given array of distinct integers
### Find Opposite Number
- Find list of available set of positive and its opposite numbers.
### Find Triplet
- Filter the given input array and returns all possible triplets whose sum of elements is less than provided maximum sum.
### Greatest_Common_Divisor
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two Numbers
- GCD of array of Numbers
- LCM (Least Common Multiplier) of two Numbers
- LCM of array of Numbers
### Linked List (Protocol Approach - Created a brand new protocol `LinkedListProtocol` with Generics)
- Created a brand new `LinkedListProtocol` that provides default implementations for basic operations of a linked list.
- Singly Linked List - `SinglyLinkedList()`
- Doubly Linked List - `DoublyLinkedList()`
- Includes features like `first`, `last`, `count`, `isEmpty`, `append`, `remove`, `contains`, `map`, `filter`.
### Minimum Coin Change
- Find Minimum Coin Change - minimum number of coin change availage for provided cent.
### Queue
A regular Queue/Deck adds elements to the back and removes from the front(FIFO). The deque/deck also allows:
- Enqueuing at the front
- Dequeuing from the back
- Peeking at both ends. Peek item from from & back.

### Equilibrium Index
-Returns the index of the element where sum of elements at lower indexes is equals to the sum of elements at higher indexes.


### Fibonacci Series
- Returns nth fibonacci number with fibonacci series
